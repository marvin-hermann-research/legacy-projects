# Legacy Projects â€“ Archive of Early Work

This repository serves as an archive of earlier personal and academic projects, primarily from the fields of software development, game design, and exploratory programming.

While these projects are not actively maintained, they represent formative stages in my technical journey and reflect my early learning processes, creative problem solving, and exploration of tools and technologies.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Contents

Each project is contained in its own subdirectory and includes:

- A brief README with project description, technologies used, and development notes
- Source code and assets (where available)
- Reflections on lessons learned

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

Legacy projects provide context for my development as a computer scientist and allow others to trace the progression from early experimentation to focused research.

They are also preserved for future reference, inspiration, or possible reactivation in new forms.
