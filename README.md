# Legacy Projects – Archive of Early Work

This repository serves as an archive of earlier personal and academic projects, primarily from the fields of software development, game design, and exploratory programming.

While these projects are not actively maintained, they represent formative stages in my technical journey and reflect my early learning processes, creative problem solving, and exploration of tools and technologies.

## Contents

This section lists all legacy projects included in this repository.  
Each project resides in its own subdirectory and contains:

- A brief README with project description, technologies used, and development notes  
- Source code and assets (where available)  
- Reflections on lessons learned

### Projects

#### [Reddit Video Generator](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/reddit-video-generator.git)  
A tool for fully automated generation of short-form videos from Reddit posts, featuring AI-generated voiceovers and synchronized subtitles.  
The system scrapes multiple subreddits, converts posts to TTS audio, generates subtitles, and merges these with pre-prepared background videos to produce ready-to-share vertical videos.

#### [Pneuma Planner Mobile](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/pneuma-planner-mobile.git)  
A Unity project implementing a simple calendar with adjustable recurring events as well as addable one-time events.  
The unique twist: a Discord server is used as the database, managed through a custom Discord bot that reads and writes `.txt` files directly in a channel.

#### [Unity Game Development Tutorials](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/unity-tutorials.git)  
A 2D Unity project compiling tutorial scripts for 12 distinct Unity mechanics, including:  
- Item pickup and collection  
- Respawning and checkpoints  
- Simple enemy programming  
- Sound effects integration  
- Health system implementation  
- Particle effects  
- Animation basics  
- Player knockback  
- Combat system mechanics  
- Shooting mechanics  
- Collision detection  
- Player movement  

This project serves as an organized reference for learning and experimenting with fundamental Unity mechanics in a practical, hands-on manner.

#### [Customizable Quiz Game](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire.git)  
A simple quiz game inspired by the classic *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?* format.  
Originally created as a birthday gift, it was later restructured to allow full customization of all 12 questions via an included `.txt` file.

## Purpose

These legacy projects trace my development as a computer scientist, showcasing the progression from my early experiments in game development to my current focus on robotics.

They are also preserved for future reference, inspiration, or possible reactivation in new forms.
